# Conways-life-game
My favourite program so far! I'm really proud of it. 
Here's the Conway's life game, a treasure of science!

The rules are simple:
-The game is on that grid, and each square is a cell. If the cell is black, it's dead. If it's white, it's alive.
If a cell has less than 2 neighbours, it dies of loneliness. If it has between 2 and 3 neighbours, it stays alive.
If it has + than 3 neighboors, it dies of overpopulation. Each sequence of evolution of the cells is called a generation.
The interesting part is to observe how the structure evolve, between "still life" forms, "spaceships", "puffers",
and many others...

The Conway's life game is used in mathematics, physics, biology, sociology, philosophy... and is simply admirable.

Now, it's your turn to play with those funny lifeforms, and experiencing the feeling of chaos!

(PS: I might add a file with different interesting structures when I collected enough of them :D )
